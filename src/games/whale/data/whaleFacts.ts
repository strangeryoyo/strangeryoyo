  'North Atlantic right whales are one of the most endangered large whales. Fewer than 350 remain.',
  'Right whales got their name because whalers considered them the "right" whale to hunt.',
  'Right whale mothers travel to warm waters off Florida and Georgia to give birth each winter.',
  'Ship strikes are the leading cause of right whale deaths. Slowing ships down saves whales.',
  'Fishing rope entanglement is the other top threat. Ropeless fishing gear can help.',
  'Right whales have no dorsal fin and can be identified by unique patterns of rough skin called callosities.',
  'A right whale\'s tail fluke can be up to 7 meters (23 feet) wide.',
  'Right whales communicate using low-frequency sounds that can travel hundreds of kilometers.',
  'Ocean noise pollution from ships and sonar makes it harder for whales to find food and mates.',
  'Right whales feed on tiny copepods, filtering thousands of gallons of water through their baleen.',
  'Climate change is pushing copepod populations northward, forcing whales into new and more dangerous areas.',
  'You can help right whales by supporting speed limits in shipping lanes and ropeless fishing gear initiatives.',
  'Right whale calves are about 4 meters (13 feet) long at birth and can gain 30 kg (66 lbs) per day nursing.',
  'Right whales can live to be over 70 years old, but many die young due to human activities.',
  'A right whale\'s body can weigh up to 70 tons - as heavy as 10 elephants.',
  'Right whales were nearly hunted to extinction by the early 1900s. Commercial whaling of them ended in 1935.',
  'Female right whales only give birth every 6 to 10 years, making population recovery very slow.',
  'Right whales sometimes "sail" by lifting their tails above the water to catch the wind.',
  'Scientists use aerial drones and underwater microphones to track and study right whales.',
  'The Gulf of Maine, Cape Cod Bay, and the Bay of Fundy are critical feeding habitats for right whales.',
  'Right whales can hold their breath for up to 40 minutes while diving for food.',
  'Each right whale can eat over a billion copepods per day during peak feeding season.',
  'Callosities on a right whale\'s head are home to tiny creatures called cyamids, or whale lice.',
  'The North Pacific right whale is even rarer, with fewer than 30 individuals left in the eastern population.',
  'Right whales migrate roughly 1,500 miles between their calving grounds in the south and feeding grounds in the north.',
  'Acoustic monitoring buoys along the US East Coast alert ships when right whales are nearby.',
  'Right whale mothers and calves form strong bonds, staying together for about a year after birth.',
  'Unlike humpback whales, right whales do not breach frequently, but when they do, it is spectacular.',
